Multi-model databases (with an emphasis in ArangoDB)
====================================================

This repository contains the presentation slides of a talk I gave at the Gothenburg Tech Radar meetup in Gothenburg, SE in January 2019.

I plan to add some example data and the queries from the presentation here soon.
I will also add links to further ArangoDB material here in the next few days.
