Multi-model databases (with an emphasis on ArangoDB)
====================================================

This repository contains the presentation slides of a talk I gave at the Gothenburg Tech Radar meetup in Gothenburg, SE in January 2019.

[presentation.pdf](https://github.com/jsteemann/GTR/blob/master/presentation.pdf) contains the slides for the presentation.

[presentation-including-foxx-example.pdf](https://github.com/jsteemann/GTR/blob/master/presentation-including-foxx-example.pdf) contains the presentation plus some extra slides that I removed to keep the length of the talk under control :smile:

[employees_0.0.1.zip](https://github.com/jsteemann/GTR/blob/master/employees_0.0.1.zip) contains the Foxx demonstration app used in the presentation with the Foxx examples. It can be installed locally to play with the example Foxx app.

I plan to add some example data and the queries from the presentation here soon.
I will also add links to further ArangoDB material here in the next few days.
